Created as part of my research for the unit Special Interest Topic in Computing. The intention is to create an abstract assembly language that allows memory to be observed and traced over the execution of an illustraive program. The design of the language is inspired by LLVM IR mostly in regard to the concept of inifite virtual registers.

**Sep** is a macro language written with C.
